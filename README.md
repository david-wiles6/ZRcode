# ZRcode

## Introduction

Hi guys, I'm David, I did ZR for 3 years and I really enjoyed it. I made this because we don't have a lot of people who have done ZR a lot here and I wanted to put some explanations of topics and a little quick start guide to ZR and coding in C. Start at basics, look through the readme on that page and look at the examples, that should get you started getting a few points, but where you can really step up your game is in the Vectors area. A lot of people are confused by vectors, but I've put the most important stuff in there for if you're getting started, this isn't really going to go over what's going on behind the scenes and the math behind vectors that makes this work. If you are interested in learning more I'll have some resources in there, but I'm not going to go super in depth when I'm writing my explanations. That said, lets take a peek.

## Basics

[Basics](https://github.com/david-wiles6/ZRcode/tree/main/Basics) Heres the link to basics, try out some of the examples. This is going to get you used to seeing "c" code, c is the coding language that we use here at ZR, as well as coding a bit yourself.

## Vectors

[Vectors](https://github.com/david-wiles6/ZRcode/tree/main/Vector%20Examples) All vectors, what you need to succeed in ZR and the wacky syntax that C uses for their vector functions

## More Complex Basics

Switch Cases, and some random other weird logic stuff that can be important at times
(I haven't added this stuff quite yet)

## Putting it all together

I've also included some more complex code that I wrote in past ZR seasons. Take a look at it and try to understand it, then go try your hand at your own code. Start in free mode and get the sphere to do some complex pattern, like a square, then find an interesting game, I like SpySpheres, look through their game manual, and make some code to score a couple points, then some more, then see if you can optimize it even more.
