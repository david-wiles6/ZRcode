# ZRcode

## Introduction

Hi guys, I'm David, I did ZR for 3 years and I really enjoyed it. I made this because we don't have a lot of people who have done ZR a lot here and I wanted to put some explanations of topics and a little quick start guide to ZR and coding in C. Start at basics, look through the readme on that page and look at the examples, that should get you started getting a few points, but where you can really step up your game is in the Vectors area. A lot of people are confused by vectors, but I've put the most important stuff in there for if you're getting started, this isn't really going to go over what's going on behind the scenes and the math behind vectors that makes this work. If you are interested in learning more I'll have some resources in there, but I'm not going to go super in depth when I'm writing my explanations. That said, lets take a peek.

## Basics

[Basics](https://github.com/david-wiles6/ZRcode/tree/main/Basics) Heres the link to basics, try out some of the examples. This is going to get you used to seeing "c" code, c is the coding language that we use here at ZR, as well as coding a bit yourself.

## Vectors

[https://github.com/david-wiles6/ZRcode/tree/main/Vector%20Examples] Just the basics, what you need to succeed in ZR and the wacky syntax that C uses for their vector functions
