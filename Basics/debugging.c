//Much like everything else in c, debugging is SUPER weird, it takes some getting used to 
//but it makes sense eventually

//Debugging is used to print variables and messages to the chat
//it uses the syntax: DEBUG(("message"));
// if you want to print a variable to the chat, it's a bit different from other coding
//languages 
//you will need to use an escape character % and then a letter associated with the variable type
//floats are %f booleans are %b and ints are %d
